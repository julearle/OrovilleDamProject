// Introduction
// Welcome to our engineering mystery
// Be prepared to handle the Oroville Dam crisis
// We want you as the user to decipher the engineering mistake that nearly lead to one of the largest engineering failures ever
// This program will guide you through the four stages that will allow you to make choices on your path to discovering what went wrong
// Good luck. And may the odds be ever in your favor.


//The buttons on the control board are, Red = stop/start hydropower, yellow = close spillway sluices, green = open spillway sluices, and blue = open spillway sluices halfway.


//RGB LED, Red >= 12” rain, Teal = 8-11”, yellow = 6-7”, green = 1-5”, purple = <1”


// Stage 1


// The Oroville Dam is located in Northern California on the Feather River, east of the city Oroville, which is east of Sacramento Valley
// At 770 feet high, it is the tallest dam in the United States and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation, and flood control
// The rainy season of 2016-2017 was Northern California's wettest winter in over 100 years.

//Tell the user that the RGB led represents the forecasted amount of precipitation for the reservoir in the incoming storm.
//What do you want to do?
   // (A) Shut-off hydropower - press red button
   // (B) Open all sluices in spillway - press green button
       //Display diagram of dam
   // (C) Open half sluices in spillway - press blue button
// Heavy rainfall resulted in record inflows from the Feather River, and the spillway was opened in January to relieve the dam pressure




// Stage 2
   // On February 7, Oroville Dam employees noticed an unusual flow pattern
   // Engineers were called to inspect the integrity of the dam
        // A splotch is noticed on the normal spillway
        // They bring it to the attention of the team of engineers


//tell the user to immediately close the spillway sluices by pressing the yellow button
        // A large area of concrete and foundation erosion was found, too large to repair
       //How should the engineers proceed?
           // (A) Divert the water to the emergency spillway - continue
           // (B) Reopen the sluices, further damaging the spillway - press green to reopen sluices

//Stage 3
   // After a second series of heavy storms in February, the spillway flow was increased to 50,000 cubic feet per
//Show another forecast with more RGB LED
   // Second forecast flashes on screen
       // The engineers have decided to let the dam build to the emergency spillway level
        // Because of this, the emergency action plan has to be put into place
// Here are your options about the emergency action plan:
// Keep in mind, evacuating people will create a panic, but not evacuating people could result in mass casualties
//choices the user can make on the computer
1. Evacuate people within a 10 mile radius
2. Evacuate people within a 50 mile radius
3. Do not evacuate anyone
Correct answer (A)!!!
// Engineers have discovered that the water flowing over the emergency spillway is eroding the hillside, threatening the integrity of the dam as a whole
// Stage 4:
// should we reopen the normal spillway to save the integrity of the dam
// (A) Yes - press green to open normal spillway sluices
// (B) No - press yellow to keep sluices closed
// The engineers decide to open the normal spillway 
// Destroys the normal spillway but saves the integrity of the dam
// Luckily no lives have been lost!! You have won the simulation. Sadly, there were millions of dollars of dam damage which is a pretty damn bad situation to be in.
