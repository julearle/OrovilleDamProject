// Introduction
// Welcome to our engineering mystery
// Be prepared to handle the Oroville Dam crisis
// We want you as the user to decipher the engineering mistake that nearly lead to one of the largest engineering failures ever
// This program will guide you through the four stages that will allow you to make choices on your path to discovering what went wrong
// Good luck. And may the odds be ever in your favor.

// Stage 1

// The Oroville Dam is located in Northern California on the Feather River, east of the city Oroville, which is east of Sacramento Valley
// At 770 feet high, it is the tallest dam in the United States and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation, and flood control
// The rainy season of 2016-2017 was Northern California's wettest winter in over 100 years.

//What do you want to do?
    // (A) Shut-off hydropower
    // (B) Open normal spillway
        //Display diagram of dam
    // (C) Open sluice(s)
// Heavy rainfall resulted in record inflows from the Feather River, and the spillway was opened in January to relieve the dam pressure


// Stage 2
    // On February 7, Oroville Dam employees noticed an unusual flow pattern
    // Engineers were called to inspect the integrity of the dam
    // A large area of concrete and foundation erosion was found, too large to repair
        //How should the engineers proceed?
            // (A) Divert the water to the emergency spillway
            // (B)
            // (C)

 //Stage 3
    // After a second series of heavy storms in February, the spillway flow was increased to 50,000 cubic feet per
